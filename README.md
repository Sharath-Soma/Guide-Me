# Guide-Me
Guide Me is a responsive slot booking web application designed for streamlined appointment scheduling. Built with HTML/CSS and AdminLTE, it features login/signup, booking forms, and a dashboard interface.

The `Guide_Me.zip` project looks like a full-fledged **appointment/booking system website**, featuring pages like:

* `bookslot.html`, `signup.html`, `login.html`, `dashboard.html`, etc.
* Uses **AdminLTE** for the dashboard theme.
* Includes customized styles, possibly dynamic logic later.

Here’s a **professional and attractive `README.md`** tailored for this project:
